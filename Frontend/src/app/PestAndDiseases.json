        "Distribution":"Throughout South Africa",
        "Status":"Pest populations are high, but don’t always cause serious damage. The exception is in stands of P. radiata where feeding on the tips can result in tip die-back.",
        "Description":"Adults have long, curved snouts and are reddish brown in colour with two patches of light grey scales on their backs. The body length of the adults ranges from 6-8mm. The larvae are yellowish white, cylindrical and legless, with light brown heads, and they are about 6mm long when fully grown.",
        "Symptoms":"Dying or dead pine shoots, often resulting in forking or branching of trees. Circular emergence holes on the bark of the main stem, which DO NOT penetrate the wood. These exit holes lead from the pupal chambers or ‘chip cocoons’ between the bark and the wood.",
        "Management":"Remove dying and dead trees, as these provide host material for the population of the beetle to increase. A native parasitoid has been detected parasitising the larvae.",

        "Symptoms":"Initial reddening of the canopy leaves which become reddish-yellow or yellow-brown, coupled with some leaf loss and the visible abundance of adults, nymphs and black egg capsules in clusters. During severe infestations, loss of leaves leads to canopy thinning and branch dieback.",
        "Management":"An egg parasitoid wasp, Cleruchoides noackae (Mymaridae) has been released as a biological control agent, with the first releases taking place in 2013.",
