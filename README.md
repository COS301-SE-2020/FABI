## Project Management Tool

Our team is using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/runtimeterrors/aca58d2e5d20454fafed42295c2c58dd?v=dde4028656ba4818b7682ed048cd425c) and GitHub Projects to monitor and manage our development. In future we would like to integrate our PM Tool with GitHub for easier access.

## Git Standards

### Workflow

[![Workflow](https://miro.medium.com/max/1316/1*5i8mTaBs05J3eGhp_CJv5Q.png)]()

### Naming Conventions

- Use grouping tokens at the beginning of branch names
  > `userManagement/<feature>`
- Define and use short lead tokens
  > `um/login` where `um` means `User Management`

### Rules of this flow

1. Anything in `master` is deployable
2. To work on something new branch off of `develop`
3. `commit` to that branch locally and **regularly** `push` to the remote branch of the same name
4. When a branch is ready to be merged, open a `pull request`
5. Another member must review the `feature` before you can `merge` it into `master`
6. Once `merged` into `master`, you **must** deploy
